# Fancy-p

`fancy-p` is a Ruby gem that extends the Kernel module to dynamically define
print methods with different characters. It allows you to create methods like
`p!`, `p@`, `p$`, etc., which print a specified character 100 times before and
after printing the provided arguments.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fancy-p'
```
